EE242 Mors Code HW
The c file in the root directory contains the code from the main.c file from the project.
The project is compressed into a zip file.
In the demo instead of my entire first and lastname only the first two and the last two letters of it are entered in morse code.

How the device works:

  Short press -> Green    
  Long press -> Blue  
  Next press -> Red 
  Next character -> Green and Blue  
  Next word i.e. space ' '-> Green Red and Blue 

When the transmit button is pressed the morse code is played in sequence from the leds and the decoded message is sent by USB CDC VCOM to the terminal.
